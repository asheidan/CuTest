CuTest is released under the GNU General Public License (GPL) and
can be used free of charge under the GPL (see license-gpl.txt for

If you do not want to be bound by the GPL terms (like the
requirement that your own application becomes GPL as well), you
may purchase a commercial license for the same product.

The commercial license gives you a non-exclusive royalty-free
right to include and use the library in closed source projects
subject to some limitations.

As CuTest source copyright holders we are able to employ Dual
Licensing which means that the same product is available under
GPL and under a commercial license.
