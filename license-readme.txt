DUAL LICENSE
-----------------------------------------------------------------

CuTest is distributed under a dual license (like MySql). It is
available under the GNU GPL as well as a commercial license. Here
is what this means. 

Our software is 100% GPL, and if yours too is 100% GPL (or OSI
compliant), then you never have to pay us for the licenses. In
all other instances, you are better served by our commercial
license. Read the details below! 

CuTest is released under the GNU General Public License (GPL) and
can be used free of charge under the GPL (see license-gpl.txt for
details).

If you do not want to be bound by the GPL terms (like the
requirement that your own application becomes GPL as well), you
may purchase a commercial license for the same product.

For more details on the commercial license contact
asimjalis@peakprogramming.com.

The commercial license gives you a non-exclusive royalty-free
right to include and use the library in closed source projects
subject to some limitations.

As CuTest source copyright holders we are able to employ dual
licensing which means that the same product is available under
GPL and under a commercial license.
