Getting Started

To add unit testing to your C code the only files you need are
CuTest.c and CuTest.h. 

CuTestTest.c and AllTests.c have been included to provide an
example of how to write unit tests and then how to aggregate them
into suites and into a single AllTests.c file. Suites allow you
to put unit tests for different parts of your code in different
files. AllTests.c combines all the suites and runs them. 

You should not have to look inside CuTest.c. Looking in
CuTestTest.c (for example usage) should be sufficient. 

After downloading the sources, run your compiler to create an
executable called AllTests.exe. For example, if you are using
Windows with the cl.exe compiler you would type: 

  cl.exe AllTests.c CuTest.c CuTestTest.c
  AllTests.exe

This will run all the unit tests associated with CuTest and print
the output on the console. You can replace cl.exe with gcc or
your favorite compiler in the command above.
